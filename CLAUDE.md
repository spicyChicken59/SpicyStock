# SpicyStock — working notes

A daily US-equity screener implementing the Stockbee/Qullamaggie 4% Momentum
Burst strategy. Scan → 2LYNCH checklist → chart render → Claude scores the
survivors from metrics plus a chart image → ranked email. Runs as a GitHub
Actions cron.

This project was inherited from another author and is being rebuilt in ranked
steps. Treat the code as evidence and the prose as suspect until checked.

## Standing rule: every step sweeps the docs

`README.md` and `.env.example` state specific facts about thresholds, failure
modes, data feeds and schedules. Several are true only until a later step lands.
**A step is not done until those two files are correct for the code as it now
stands.** This is part of every step's definition of done, not a cleanup task
for later.

Known scheduled falsifications:

| when this lands | what goes stale |
|---|---|
| ~~Step 3 sets `feed=` on the bars request~~ done | ~~`.env.example`'s "no `feed=` is set anywhere"~~ swept, along with the IEX-default paragraph it sat in |
| ~~Step 4 replaces the 5,000,000-share floor~~ done | ~~`.env.example`'s absolute-floor note, README's Layer-1 filter description and Costs volume numbers~~ all swept |
| ~~Step 5 makes failures loud~~ done | ~~`.env.example`'s "these fail in three different ways" block~~ swept |
| ~~Step 6 fixes the test suite~~ done | ~~the `detect_burst` comment in `.gitignore`, the broken-test note in README~~ swept |
| ~~Step 9 emits `docs/data.json`~~ done | ~~the "hand-authored fixture" caveat in README's dashboard section~~ swept — the committed copy is still the fixture and says so in `run.fixture`; the pipeline writes the real one |
| `evening.yml` keeps `docs/` between runs (commit-back or artifact round-trip) | README's "Does the history actually accumulate?" section, which currently says it does not, and the stale `charts/` path in that workflow's upload step |
| The universe widens past `data/symbols.txt` | the 230-name figures in README's diagram, Tuning and Costs sections |

## Standing rule: no line numbers in comments or docs

Cite functions, not `file.py:NN`. Three separate citations rotted inside a
single step's own commits. `get_clients()` is stable; `scanner.py:78` is not.

## Standing rule: prove a test can fail

A test that cannot fail is worse than no test, because it reports safety that
is not there. Three of this project's "rejection path" tests observed a
different rule failing than the one they named — the 4% gain, the rule the
product is named after, could be deleted with the whole suite green.

**When you change or add a rule, delete it and watch the suite go red.** If it
stays green, the test is shaped, not load-bearing. This was mandatory for steps
4 and 7, which changed the scan filter and the 2LYNCH maths; both were done
that way. Half the discipline is the inverse check: break a rule the test does
NOT name and confirm the test fails too, rather than passing while a different
rule does the rejecting. `tests/test_scanner.py`'s `_only_failing()` makes that
a precondition of every rejection test instead of an inequality picked by eye.

The doc-sweep rule above failed on three consecutive commits because it relied
on remembering. `tests/test_docs_are_true.py` now enforces the mechanically
checkable parts — the test count, the universe size, the email's universe
string, and `.env.example`'s `feed=` claim. Prose still needs a human.

## Verification is by execution

The strongest findings in this rebuild came from running the code, not reading
it — reproducing a crash, sourcing a hostile `.env`, testing `git check-ignore`
against real paths. A claim that was argued rather than executed is a lead, not
a finding. This applies to reviewing agents too.

Twice, a fix was worse than the bug it replaced: an env-loader that leaked the
environment was swapped for one that executed the file as shell, and a
`.gitignore` round that anchored three rules added two more unanchored. **Check
that a fix did not introduce a new defect of the same class.**

## Environment constraints

- **No live market data.** The sandbox proxy blocks Yahoo and Alpaca. Anything
  requiring a real trading day has to be validated by the user locally. Reason
  from the SDK and synthetic frames instead; do not fake a result.
- **Free Alpaca plan.** No SIP subscription. The IEX feed carries a fraction of
  consolidated volume, which is why the absolute share threshold has to become
  a relative one (step 4).
- **There is a regression net now, with known holes.** `pytest tests/` runs 331
  tests with no network and no API keys (step 6a) — a count that is behind the
  suite until the batch in flight lands. The scan filter's thresholds ARE
  asserted now (step 4) and the 2LYNCH checks are too (step 7), each
  mutation-tested. Untested:
  `get_universe()` and the symbol-file parser, `main()`'s exit code, and the
  real SDK wire shapes — the boundaries are doubles, so an SDK change passes
  here.

## Local run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env              # single-quote every value
set -a; . ./.env; set +a          # this sources .env as a shell script
python -m src.pipeline evening --dry-run
```

`--dry-run` skips only the email; it still calls Alpaca and Claude.

## Rebuild order

1. ~~Repo hygiene — `.gitignore`, truthful `.env.example`, secret scanning~~ done
2. ~~Shrink the universe to a checked-in symbol list~~ done
3. ~~Fix the data request — split adjustment, freshness assertion~~ done
4. ~~Relative volume thresholds, percentile liquidity gate~~ done
5. ~~Fail loud~~ done
6. ~~6a: real tests, offline mode, CI~~ done · 6b: threshold + canary assertions, after 4 and 7
7. ~~Fix the 2LYNCH math (`L` is sign-blind, `Y` excludes the burst day)~~ done
8. ~~Harden the LLM layer (`temperature=0` — which is a TypeError in anthropic 1.x; it goes via `extra_body`)~~ done
9. ~~Persist every scored candidate plus forward returns~~ done in `src/` —
   `docs/data.json` + `docs/ledger.json`, forward returns filled by later runs.
   NOT done end to end: nothing the run writes into `docs/` survives a GitHub
   Actions container, so in CI the history restarts every night. That is one
   change to `evening.yml` (see the table above and README)
10. Resolve morning/evening and statefulness

Full-market scanning comes after all ten.

**Open decision — the universe is now 230 names.** Step 2 traded ~11,000 symbols
for a hand-curated list to make steps 3-8 testable in seconds instead of twenty
minutes. That is a real strategy narrowing, not just a speed fix: 4% momentum
bursts are most common in the small- and mid-caps this list excludes. The list is
a scaffold. Replacing it with a generated, screened universe is required before
this is a real screener, and it is not one of the ten steps above.
